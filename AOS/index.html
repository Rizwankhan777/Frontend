From what I'm seeing documented (and I am just finding out about this repository), you should be able to set an attribute on your element to control this.
Whatever element you are trying to animate once, set the attribute " data-aos-once='true' ". 
If you want ALL of your animated elements to only animate once, set your AOS.init({}) object with a property of "once: true".

<script>
  AOS.init({
        duration: 1200, // depend your need
        once: true  // depend your need
   })
</script>
